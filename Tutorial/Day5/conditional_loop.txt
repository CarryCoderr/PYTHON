Python Conditions and If statements
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
Else
The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
Elif
The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

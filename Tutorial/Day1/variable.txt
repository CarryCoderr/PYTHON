Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Built-in Data Types in python 
In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType

Reserved words in Python
Here is the list of all the reserved words in Python.
Note - This list may change with different versions of Python. Python 3 has 33 while Python 2 has 30 reserved words. The print was removed from Python 2 keywords and added as a built-in Python function.

False	def	  if	   raise
None	   del	import	 return
True	 elif	 in	 try
and	 else	  is	         while
as	except	lambda	with
assert	finally	nonlocal	yield
break	for	not
class	form	or
continue	global	pass

Snake case separates each word with an underscore character (_).

When using snake case, all letters need to be lowercase.

When using camel case, you start by making the first word lowercase. Then, you capitalize the first letter of each word that follows.

So, a capital letter appears at the start of the second word and at each new subsequent word that follows it.
